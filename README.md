# A-Little-Escape
The player is a child trapped in a “haunted” house and must solve puzzles to collect four keys and escape the house. Each key will be found on each of the four floors of the house: basement, first floor, second floor, and attic. There will be horror aspects, such as scary sounds or falling objects, to give the house a haunted atmosphere.
